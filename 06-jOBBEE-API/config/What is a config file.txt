In Node.js, a config file is used to manage configuration options and 
settings for an application. It typically contains parameters that might 
change based on the environment (development, testing, production) 
such as database connection details, API keys, or application ports. 
This allows you to easily change settings without altering the application's
 code. Config files can be in various formats like JSON, YAML, or even 
 JavaScript modules exporting configuration objects.

Note: you neve ever add '.env' file to git
