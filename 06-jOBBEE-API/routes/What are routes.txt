In Node.js, routes are used to define different endpoints and how 
the server should respond to client requests to these endpoints. 
Each route can have one or more handler functions, which are executed 
when the route is matched. Routes are defined by a path and an HTTP method 
(GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.), and they help organize the logic of 
your application by associating functions with specific request paths 
and methods. This makes it easier to manage and scale web applications.
