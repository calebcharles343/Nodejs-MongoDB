In Node.js, controllers are JavaScript functions that handle the logic 
for processing client requests and returning responses. 
- They are typically used in MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture 
to separate the concerns of an application. 
- Controllers interact with models to retrieve data and decide 
how to present that data, often by selecting a view. 
- They act as an intermediary between models, which handle data, and views,
which handle presentation.
