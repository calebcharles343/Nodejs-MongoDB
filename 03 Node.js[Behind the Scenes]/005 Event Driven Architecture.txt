In Node.js, Event-Driven Architecture is implemented using the 
EventEmitter class from the 'events' module. This allows objects 
to emit named events which cause function objects ("listeners") to 
be called. It's a core concept in Node.js and is used in many built-in 
modules. Would you like me to look up some resources or examples on how 
to implement EDA in Node.js?
