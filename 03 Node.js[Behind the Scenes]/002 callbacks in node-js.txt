In Node.js, a callback is a function passed into another function as an 
argument, which is then invoked inside the outer function to complete 
some kind of routine or action. Callbacks are a fundamental part of 
Node.js and are used to handle asynchronous operations like reading 
files, making HTTP requests, or querying a database.

Here's a simple example of a callback used in reading a file 
asynchronously with the `fs` module:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

fs.readFile('/path/to/file', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error('Error reading the file:', err);
    return;
  }
  console.log('File content:', data);
});
```

In this example, `fs.readFile` is an asynchronous function that 
reads the file at the given path and takes a callback function as its third argument. This callback is called when the file read operation is complete. The callback receives two arguments: `err` (error object, if any error occurred) and `data` (the content of the file).
