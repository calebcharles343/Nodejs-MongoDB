Node.js: 
is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment,
built with the chrome v8 runtime engine
that executes JavaScript code outside of a web browser. 
It's designed to build scalable network applications and 
can handle many connections simultaneously. 
It operates on a single-threaded event-driven architecture, 
which makes it efficient and suitable for I/O-heavy workloads.

Key features include:
- **Asynchronous and Event-Driven**: All APIs of the Node.js library 
are asynchronous, meaning non-blocking. It essentially 
means a Node.js-based server never waits for an API to return data.

- **Single-Threaded but Highly Scalable**: Node.js uses a single-threaded 
model with event looping.

- **No Buffering**: Node.js applications never buffer any data. 
They simply output the data in chunks.

Companies that use node.js:
- LinkedIn
- Netflix
- Walmart
- Uber
- Paypal
- Ebay

Where to use node.js:
- I/O bound applications e.g human to system and sytem to human
- Data Streaming applications e.g Netflix
- Real-time applications e.g Chat
- JSON APIs based applications

Where not use Node.js:
- CPU intensiive applications: because node.js is single threaded


It's commonly used for creating web servers, developing backend services (APIs), and building tools and utilities.
